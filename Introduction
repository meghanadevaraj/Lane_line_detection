Lane line detection is a crucial task in the field of computer vision, particularly for autonomous vehicles and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). The goal of this project is to identify and track lane lines on a road from a video feed using Python and OpenCV. This process involves several key steps: first, preprocessing the video frames by converting them to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur to reduce noise, and using edge detection techniques such as the Canny edge detector. Then, perspective transformation is applied to get a bird's-eye view of the lanes, which simplifies the detection. Thresholding is used to isolate the lane lines based on color, and a sliding window technique is employed to detect the lane pixels. The Hough Transform can also be used to detect straight lines representing the lane boundaries. The project allows the visualization of the original video alongside the processed frame with lane lines overlaid, offering real-time lane detection. By utilizing libraries like OpenCV for image processing and NumPy for numerical operations, this project serves as a foundation for building autonomous driving systems, providing valuable insights into vehicle navigation, safety, and lane-keeping assistance.
